<p>This extension enables advanced comparison of sequences of HTTP requests and their responses. It is particularly useful for analyzing differences and similarities between two sets of HTTP sequences.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Context Menu Integration:</strong> Send requests from Burp Suite's Proxy tab to the extension via the context menu.</li>
  <li><strong>Sequence Overview:</strong> View sequences with customizable names, number of requests, and total response length. Sequence order can be reversed.</li>
  <li><strong>Side-by-Side Sequence Display:</strong> Display two sequences simultaneously for easy comparison, with separate tables for each sequence.</li>
  <li><strong>Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Analysis:</strong> Identify the LCS between two sequences using a Dynamic Programming algorithm. Color-coded requests for easy distinction.</li>
  <li><strong>Request/Response Diff View:</strong> View detailed differences in request/response content, with color-coded diff markers for added, modified, and deleted content.</li>
  <li><strong>Scroll Synchronization:</strong> Optional scroll synchronization between the two sequence panels.</li>
  <li><strong>Auto-Select Mode:</strong> Automatically select the corresponding request in the other sequence when one request is selected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Select requests from Burp Suite's HTTP history or repeater.</li>
  <li>Right-click and choose <code class="InlineCode">Send to Sequence Comparer</code>.</li>
  <li>Open the Sequence Comparer tab to analyze sequences:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Use LCS analysis for comparison.</li>
    <li>View differences using the diff algorithm.</li>
    <li>Enable scroll synchronization and auto-select mode as needed.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
